        \begin{itemize}
            \item A language model is a tool that helps computers understand and process human language by learning patterns in large amounts of text.
            % \item It predicts the next word or part of a sentence based on the context, which is useful for tasks like translating languages, answering questions, and generating text.
            \item They are widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
            \item They are used in applications ranging from simple text predictions to complex tasks like machine translation and question answering.
        \end{itemize}
